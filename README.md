In this project a password generator is created. The aim is to create a strong password dependent on the users selections. 
Users choose between numberic vales, special characters, upper and lower case letters along with the length of the password. 
This can solve the peski  problem of creating a password on your own that may or may not be a strong password.
In this project I learned about using the math.floor to get whole numbers while using * to randomize the length of an array to be used. I got bit more work on the funtions in javascrip.
